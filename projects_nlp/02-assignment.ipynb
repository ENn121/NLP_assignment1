In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. Deep learning libraries such as keras and pytorch are also allowed.  You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",

For this, you can use the Pearson correlation co-efficient (`pearsonr`), which is included in scipy (`scipy.stats`). Be careful converting your dictionaries to lists for this purpose, the data for the two datasets needs to be in the same order for correct comparison using correlation. Write a general function, then apply it to each of the similarity score dictionaries.\n",
